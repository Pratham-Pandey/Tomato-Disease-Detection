# Tomato-Disease-Detection

Tomato Disease Classifier aims to identify the disease of a tomato plant by inspecting its leaves. The model categories the plant into 10 classes. Out of which 9 of them are disease and 1 is "Healthy" Class. A webiste is also created for "Tomato Disease Classification" where user will upload the image of plant leaf and the model will predict the type of disease. The website has been created using Flask but has NOT BEEN HOSTED yet. To run the site on local system run the "app.py" file on local system to get the URL.
