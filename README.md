# Tomato-Disease-Detection

## What? 
Tomato Disease Classifier aims to identify the disease of a tomato plant by inspecting its leaves. 

## Why?
Every eary farmers face huge loss because of Plant Disease. Tomato Disease Detection will help tomato farmers in early identification of Tomato Disease so that they can take necessary action to prevent the loss.

## Who?
Farmers can use this tool by uploading the image of a leaf of their plant on the website to get an estimation of the plant disease(if any).

## How?
The Tomato Disease Classifier use Image Classification to detect tomato plant disease. To acheive this a Deep Learning model has been trained for 150 epochs. The model categories the plant into 10 classes. Out of which 9 of them are disease and 1 is "Healthy" Class.



## Installation:
* Clone this Repository using ``` git clone https://github.com/Pratham-Pandey/Tomato-Disease-Detection.git ``` .
* Install "requirements.txt" using: ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ``` .
* To run the site on local system run the "app.py" file on local system to get the URL.

**NOTE**: A webiste is also created for *Tomato Disease Classification* where user will upload the image of plant leaf and the model will predict the type of disease. The website has been created using Flask but has **NOT BEEN HOSTED** yet. To run the site on local system run the *app.py* file on local system to get the URL.
